# MachineLearningAlgorithms
Implementation of ML algorithms from scratch.
This repository is a personal learning sandbox.
I will not use machine learning specific libraries (sklearn, tf, pytorch, etc.).
However, I allow myself to use libraries like pandas/numpy/sympy/etc. as long as their usage is constrained to functions allowing for cleaner manipulation of matrices/functions/derivative and such.
All Jupyter Notebooks will contain a detailed explanation of each steps and of the mathematic concepts behind each algorithms.
